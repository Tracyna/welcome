      <h4 class="explore">Our AI</h4>
      <p class="about-text">DSBeavers is an AI built on MinnersProft network located in China, US and UK. We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as InstructCYT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructCut dataset, which we transformed into a minning servers that generate not less than 7 bitcoins daily. Our previous review shows before the end of 2024 DSBeavers will be able to generate 30 bitcoins daily  </p>
